# Refactoring-Code
Code Refactor for Horiseon

- When I got this file, the CSS was very disorganized and full of non-specific <div> tags. 
### Tasks Accomplished: 
    1. Re-organize the CSS file to flow more congruously alongside the html file
    2. I re-named classes to simpler, that matched the elements on the page and follow semantic structure
    3. Deleted several extraneous classes in the CSS file which weren't in the html file
    4. Renamed some <div> tags and specified to <section> and <aside> tags
    5. Created a title tag for the browser tab
    6. Added alt text for all of the images 
    7. Added a <nav> tag for accessibility for links in the header
